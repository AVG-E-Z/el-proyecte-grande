# Savings Sage 
Savings Sage is a budgeting webapp, that lets you track your finances via creating and customizing bank accounts, transactions and categories. This application was created as a part of Codecool's Fullstack Web Developer course and is still under development by the two team members. There are many more features planned for the near future (see more about these below).
